# inventory
Inventory is a python script that allows a user to look through a csv exported by EPOS for issues in current inventory.

# Requirements
pandas is needed to run this script

# About inventory
I'm writing this to help at my current work place on my free time to develop developer skills.

# Things Learned
The things I've learned are:
    * Find what question wanted to ask on average, build functions to answer those
    * Find out how to clean this specific dataset and build functions that help go through the process quicker
    * Manually go through the data a few times before writing a script to do it
    * Make a default directory style to make "looking" through files and flow easier
    * Work on one specific task at a time->save->test->add->commit
